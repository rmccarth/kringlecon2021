// Note: For this lab, we will be working with QRP Corporation's CQC-11 FPGA.
// The CQC-11 operates with a 125MHz clock.
// Your design for a tone generator must support the following 
// inputs/outputs:
// (NOTE: DO NOT CHANGE THE NAMES. OUR AUTOMATED GRADING TOOL
// REQUIRES THE USE OF THESE NAMES!)
// input clk - this will be connected to the 125MHz system clock
// input rst - this will be connected to the system board's reset bus
// input freq - a 32 bit integer indicating the required frequency
//              (0 - 9999.99Hz) formatted as follows:
//              32'hf1206 or 32'd987654 = 9876.54Hz
// output wave_out - a square wave output of the desired frequency
// you can create whatever other variables you need, but remember
// to initialize them to something!

// There is NO NEED to do any rounding. Just run this until the random frequency falls in the appropriate range (4/5 times).
